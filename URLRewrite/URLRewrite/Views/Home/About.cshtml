<h2>IIS-URL-Rewrite-Useragent</h2>

<p>URL rewrite in IIS after checking user agent.</p>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>I was creating an AngularJS application for a client when I hit a roadblock. The project needed the ability to support facebook Open Graph properties, pinterest rich pins, stumble upon links, google plus links. All the above were failing.</p>

<h3>The reason</h3>

<p>All the above mentioned crawlers do not execute javascript. So I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. :(. So the soution I designed was to do a url rewrite for all the requests coming from the above said crawlers to a page generated using PhantomJS. Simple right? not quite. Since I already had html5 type url rewrites set up etc it was pretty cumbersome to write all the URL rewrite logic for IIS. At one point I was not sure how the user agent strings actually looked like. So born was this project.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This project is going to help me understand the user agent string that is used by the above mentioned crawlers and how to do url the rewrites for them.</p>
